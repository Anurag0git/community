# GSoC 2024. Gradle Build Server â€“ support for Android projects

This project aims to enhance [Gradle Build Server](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle) project from Microsoft by integrating powerful Android Studio features. Bridging the build process gap between [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Gradle Build Server](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle), will significantly improve the development experience for many Android developers using Text Editors/IDEs which utilize the [Build Server Protocol (BSP)](https://build-server-protocol.github.io).

## Status
Passed mid-term evaluation with successful completion of composite build support, Java Home handling under review and android support in review.

## Goal

1. Add support for composite builds. ([vscode-gradle issue #1435](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-gradle/issues/1435))
2. Java Home detection and sending notification on incompatibility. ([issue #75](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/issues/75) & [issue #76](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/issues/76))
3. Add Android support with resolution of Android Java projects.

## Rationale

As the popularity of Android development grows, the need for efficient build automation tools like the Gradle Build Server becomes increasingly important. However, current limitations in identifying and managing common Gradle functionalities used in Android projects within the server can hinder developer workflows. This project aims to bridge this gap by introducing functionalities specifically tailored to Android development.

## Deliverables

### Composite-Build Support ([vscode-gradle issue #1435](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-gradle/issues/1435))

**Status:** Complete (Merged)

**Pull Requests:** [#154](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/154), [#160](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/160)

**Objectives:**

- Add support for building projects with [composite builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html).

**Pre-requisites:**

- Understanding Gradle API and Gradle Tooling API

**Implemented Features:**

- Took over some work already done by [@Arthurm1](https://github.com/Arthurm1) in [PR#122](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/122), into [PR#154](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/154).
- Utilized build actions to retrieve source sets from composite build projects which allowed for dependency susbtitution.
- Fixed language extension downcast issue in [PR#160](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/160) which was breaking composite builds.

### Improved Gradle Java Home Handling ([issue #75](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/issues/75) and [issue #76](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/issues/76))

**Status:** Complete (Merged)

**Pull Request:** [#165](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/165)

**Objectives:**

- Build the project with default configurations, if Java Home is incompatible try and find a suitable Java Home.
- If incompatible Java Home is detected notify client of the incompatibility. 

**Implemented Features:**

- Probe build the project to find if default Java Home configuration is compatible.
- In case of incompatibility try to find a compatible Java Home in the given order:
    1. GradleJavaHome (Gradle Properties)
    2. UserJavaHome (Retrieved from preferences)
- Notify client if project's default Java Home was incompatible and we switched to a different Java Home for compatibility.
- Notify client if the fallback logic couldn't find a compatible Java Home.

### Android Support

**Status:** Complete (Under Review)

**Pull Request:** [#173](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/pull/173)

**Objectives:**

- Providing build targets for Android Java projects to the client

**Pre-requisites:**

- Understanding the entire Android build process and changes to the Android Gradle Plugin.

**Implemented Features:**

- Extracting Build Variants and their properties from Android projects via reflection.
- Populating a GradleSourceSet (build target model) with build variants properties.
- Providing Android SDK components and R file via dependency modules of the build target.

**Limitations:**

- The current implementation only allows for recognition of Java sources.
- `R.jar` file is provided via ModuleDependency but it may only work for Android Applcation projects.
- If `ANDROID_HOME` is not configured there is no fallback implementation, the Android Components will simply not be provided.

## Documentation:

- Detailed developer documentation for the implemented functionalities (composite builds, Java Home detection and sending notification on incompatibility, android support).
- Documentation covering usage instructions and troubleshooting steps for the added functionalities.
- Using clear examples and diagrams to enhance understanding.

## Unit and Integration Testing:

- Implement unit tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the implemented functionalities.
- Unit tests thoroughly cover specific components like composite builds logic, language extension downcasting, Gradle Java Home handling logic, and build target verification logic for android projects.
- Implement integration tests to verify seamless functionality within the Gradle Build Server environment.
- Integration tests simulate real-world build scenarios and interactions between different server components.

## Collaboration and Learning

Throughout the program I have collaborated with all of my mentors and gained invaluable insights into open source development - best practices, project management and contributions. They also helped me learn how to explore large project repositories for research.

My work on this project, significantly expanded my skill set, encompassing JSON-RPC, Language Server Protocol, Build Server Protocol, Gradle API, Gradle Tooling API, testing methodologies and merging techniques with git. I successfully applied these learnings to produce the mentioned outcomes.

If anyone is interested to continue the work and bring further support for Android projects in the [GradleBuildServer](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle) then you can get started [here](https://github.com/microsoft/build-server-for-gradle/labels/android).
