# Gradle in Hacktoberfest

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors.
Many component maintainers from the Gradle ecosystem, e.g. the
[Gradle plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle),
already include their projects in Hacktoberfest.

In 2024, we plan to participate as an organization,
and to offer nice special-edition swag to the key contributors.
