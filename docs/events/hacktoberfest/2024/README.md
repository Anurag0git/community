[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors.
Many component maintainers from the Gradle ecosystem, e.g. the
[Gradle plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle),
already include their projects in Hacktoberfest.

In October, Gradle will participate in Hacktoberfest 2024!
This year, we are looking forward to offering a few featured projects, hosting online events for newcomer open-source contributors,
and sending custom Gradle goodies for those who contribute to the projects.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects we have in mind  for the event:

* Making the Gradle plugins compatible with Gradle Configuration Cache ([list of plugin statuses on GitHub](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/13490))
* Experimenting with Declarative Gradle and sharing feedback
* Contributing new Gradle solutions to [Gradle Cookbook](https://community.gradle.org/cookbook/), and plugin documentation improvements
* Learning Gradle Build Tool with free courses on [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog)

More featured projects will be added soon,
maintainers are welcome to add their components if there are contributor guidelines
and some issues that can be taken by contributors.

## Swag

In addition to common Hacktoberfest swag,
we plan to send something nice to those who make substantial contributions to
Gradle Build Tool and its ecosystem.

    The details will be announced soon.

## Events
