[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers and contributors.
Many component maintainers from the Gradle ecosystem, such as the
[Gradle plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle),
already include their projects in Hacktoberfest.

This year, Gradle is participating in Hacktoberfest!
We are looking forward to featuring projects, hosting online events for new open-source contributors,
and sending custom Gradle goodies for those who contribute to the projects.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects we have in mind for the event:

* Making Gradle plugins compatible with Gradle Configuration Cache ([list of plugin statuses on GitHub](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/13490))
* Experimenting with Declarative Gradle and sharing feedback
* Contributing new Gradle solutions to the [Gradle Cookbook](https://community.gradle.org/cookbook/)
* Learning Gradle Build Tool with free courses on [DPE University](https://dpeuniversity.gradle.com/app/catalog)

More featured projects will be added soon.
Maintainers are welcome to add their project if they provide contributor guidelines
and issues that can be hacked on by contributors.

## Swag

In addition to our Hacktoberfest swag,
we plan to send something nice to those who make substantial contributions to
Gradle Build Tool and its ecosystem.

    The details will be announced soon.
