# Gradle Community Events

In Gradle, we organize multiple online events,
and also often attend Java and open source community conferences
like Devoxx or FOSDEM.
We are happy to meet at those events.

## Mentorship Programs

In Gradle, we want to participate in the mentorship programs
and look for potential mentors and mentees.
For example, in 2023 we participated in
Google Summer of Code and sponsored interns in the Major League Hacking program
(see the [2023 Lunar Year in Review](https://blog.gradle.org/2023-lunar-new-year) post)
