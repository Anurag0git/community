## The Survey

![Test](./images/hero.png)

The 2024 survey focuses on Gradle Build Tool developer experience.  We're aiming to discover common pain points and understand what use cases are particularly frustrating.
This is why the form is quite long, and we will appreciate your patience.
The survey will be open for responses until the end of the year,
and we intend to make it a recurrent event.
