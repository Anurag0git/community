## HOWTOs

### Editing and Adding Pages

A few tips:

- All the pages on this site are just Markdown
- If needed, we can a lot of machineryy reserved, e.g. for including code templates, macros, etc.
  And we can add more MkDocs plugins if needed.
- The Table of Contents is currently located in [mkdocs.yml](../mkdocs.yml).
  When adding new pages, please update the ToC so that it is discoverable.

### Adding New Categories

At the moment, we just add categories as convenient based opn the consensus.
If you add a new major category, better to discuss it in advance.
